Python scripts that creates clear, comprehensive heatmaps,ARIMA, Holt's linear trend model using pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Perfect for quick insights into complex datasets.

Heatmap Generator

This Python script, data_bioregen_heatmap.py, is designed to generate heatmaps from provided data samples. It visualizes the measurements of various attributes such as tensile strength, flexibility, water resistance, phytotoxicity, and biodegradability for different samples. This script is useful for researchers, data analysts, or anyone interested in data visualization.

ARIMA Predictive Data Model

This Python script, bioregen_ARIMA.py, is designed to generate prediction model from provided data samples. It visualizes the measurements of biodegradability for different samples and predict the 100% biodegradability This script is useful for researchers, data analysts, or anyone interested in data visualization.

Here is the script with data bootstrapping data_bioregen_bootstrapping_arima.py

Holt's Linear Trend model

This Python script, bioregen_holts.py, is designed to generate prediction model from provided data samples. It visualizes the measurements of biodegradability for different samples and predict the 100% biodegradability This script is useful for researchers, data analysts, or anyone interested in data visualization.

Installation To run this script, you will need Python installed on your system along with several dependencies:

pandas numpy matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

Copy code pip install pandas numpy matplotlib Usage After installing the required libraries, you can run the script using Python. If you have a specific dataset you wish to visualize, ensure it is formatted according to the script's expectations (samples as rows and attributes as columns). To execute the script:

python <script_name>
